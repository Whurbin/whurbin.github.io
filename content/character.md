(<b>SPOILERS</b>) Deep in the jungles of Chult, a Hill Dwarf Barbarian by the name of Whurbin makes camp. Estella, a twilight cleric and his last companion, prepares an impenetrable dome for them to rest within. In the hot, humid jungle, worn and weary, they look back toward the Tomb that drove their comrades mad and ultimately separated them. Some of them dead, but the Death Curse lifted, they can rest knowing that someday, they may see their friends once again. Today, Whurbin prepares to go find his comrade Sallenjer, cast into Avernus by the lich Acererak before fleeing their onslaught.

Whurbin, born on the outskirts of Sundabar, lost his parents at a young age. Soon after, he was taken in by the men of a militia training camp. Year after year, he would see his friends go off to battle. Some would come back, others would not, and Whurbin would listen to their stories of battle, eagerly waiting his turn to join them.

When his time came, he would serve his city in battle, quickly promoting through the ranks and gaining a reputation for his strength, loyalty, and beard.

Whurbin's beard, however, was something special. Gifted to him by the Great Girthy Bearded God Gundrik, his beard would double as a Beard of Holding and grow to full length overnight. Whurbin cherished his beard and guarded it as a sacred relic to his God. Whurbin could take a lot of abuse and turn the other cheek, but if damage was done to his beard, he would pursue the offender to their death. Late some evenings, you could hear Whurbin proselytizing about the Great Girthy One to his companions so that they too could have strong beards.

Throughout their heroic battles, puzzles, and challenges, loot would sometimes fall out of his beard to reward the party for their efforts. At times in fierce situations, players would sometimes jump into his beard for safety, even shooting arrows from within to fell an enemy.

(<b>SPOILERS</b>) Years later, while serving in the Flaming Fists in Balders Gate, he hears of the Death Curse which ravages the island of Chult. Intrigued, he joins an unlikely band of adventurers, financed by one of the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru to go and lift the Death Curse.

"Have I told you of the virtues of the Great Girthy Bearded God Gundrik?!?!?!
He looks on us all, bearded and un-bearded, and gives favor and strong beards to those who take faith in his beardedness!"
